******IMPORTANT*****

Lines begining with "#" are commented lines and ignored
Empty lines and white spaces are all ignored.

One operand functions like "in,inc,dec,.." should be in that shape with these spaces to work or it would cause errors

e.g: "in  R1" or "in R1"    (if it becomes in this shape "in   R1" , it will cause errors due to extra spaces).
